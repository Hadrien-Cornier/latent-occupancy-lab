# latent-occupancy-lab
A research sandbox to estimate indoor occupancy and pollutant exposure without ground-truth labels. It uses a physics-based digital twin to generate synthetic CO₂ and pollutant data, enabling controlled comparison of unsupervised latent-state methods, from slope heuristics to HMMs and switching Kalman filters.
